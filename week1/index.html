            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Daiki Saito, and I was born in Osaka, Japan, raised in Langley, Canada, and came to California about 4 years ago.
                    I am a senior majoring in International Development Studies and Geography. 
                    <br>
                    Having a chef-dad, cooking has always been one of my favorite things to do since I was little.
                    You can check out my delicious Takoyaki recipe
                    <a href="takoyaki.html">here</a>.
                    <br>
                    As a critical digital map maker, I hope to create maps that clearly illustrate the persistent inequalities we see in the world today and raise awareness about them.
